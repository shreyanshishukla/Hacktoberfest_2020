<h1>Question</h1>



You are given an array of N integers A1,A2,…,AN and three more integers X,p, and k

An operation on the array is defined to be: replace the k-th smallest integer in the array with any integer you want.

Output the minimum number of operations you must perform on the array (possibly 0
operations) to make the p-th smallest element of the array equal to X. If it is impossible to do so output −1

<br>

Note: the k-th smallest number in an array is the k

-th number from the left when the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
<h1>Input</h1>

                The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T
                test cases follows.
                <br>
                The first line of each test case contains four integers N,X,p,k
                respectively.
                <br>
                The second line contains N
                space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN

    .

<h1>Output</h1>

                For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum number of operations you 
                must perform to make X
                the p-th smallest element or −1 if its impossible to do so.
